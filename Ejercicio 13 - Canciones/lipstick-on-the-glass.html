    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>
      [Verse 1]<br />
      Oh, it could be exciting<br />
      Excuse for a change if we don't work the way<br />
      We were<br />
      Oh, but nothing seems inviting<br />
      Except the image of your open arms calling back<br />
      To me<br /><br />
      [Chorus]<br />
      I take you back<br />
      Yeah, I know it seems surprising when there's lipstick still on the
      glass<br />
      And the full moon rising, but it's me who makes myself mad, mm<br />
      I'll take you<br /><br />
      [Verse 2]<br />
      Oh, my body does deceive me<br />
      Just as did yours<br />
      Though we're fighting different wars<br />
      In our ways<br />
      Oh, but there's no pleasure in resisting<br />
      So go ahead and kiss me<br /><br />
      [Chorus]<br />
      I take you back<br />
      Yeah, I know it seems surprising when there's lipstick still on the
      glass<br />
      And the full moon rising, but it's me who makes myself mad, mm<br />
      I'll take you<br /><br />
      [Bridge]<br />
      Once more, once more<br />
      Once more<br />
      Once more, once more<br />
      Once more<br />
      Once more<br />
      You know nothing would've needed deciding<br />
      Had you just simply asked<br />
      But the full moon rising, and it's me<br /><br />
      [Chorus]<br />
      I take you back<br />
      Yeah, I know it seems surprising when there's lipstick still on the
      glass<br />
      And the full moon rising, but it's me who makes myself mad, mm<br />
      I'll take you<br />
