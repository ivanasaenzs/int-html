    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>
      [Verse 1]<br />
      Eighteen, failed dream<br />
      Attracted to a bad scene<br />
      Think I'll make a couple errands<br />
      Cataclysmic age to be<br />
      When you're out of luck and your mother's in need<br />
      I made my money for the crooks and pushers<br />
      In the hopes that I claw somethin' together for tonight<br />
      I'm going out<br />
      Oh, tonight I'm going out<br /><br />
      [Chorus]<br />
      I'm only gettin' started<br />
      Don't mean to be disheartened<br />
      Felt like giving up so many times before<br />
      But I'm still here grinding<br />
      I'm only gettin' started<br />
      Don't need to be disheartened<br />
      Felt like giving up so many times before<br />
      But I'm still here grinding<br /><br />
      [Verse 2]<br />
      I came home and you were on the floor<br />
      Floored by the letters and the council rigmarole<br />
      What I wouldn't do to get you out this hole<br />
      For tonight I've gotta let go<br />
      But tonight you've gotta let me let go<br /><br />
      [Chorus]<br />
      I'm only gettin' started<br />
      Don't mean to be disheartened<br />
      Felt like giving up so many times before<br />
      But I'm still here grinding<br />
      I'm only gettin' started<br />
      Don't mean to be disheartened<br />
      Felt like giving up so many times before<br />
      But I'm still here grinding<br /><br />
      [Post-Chorus]<br />
      I'm gettin' started<br />
      Gettin' started<br />
      I'm gettin' started<br />
      I'm only gettin' started<br /><br />
      [Chorus]<br />
      I'm only gettin' started (I'm gettin' started)<br />
      Don't mean to be disheartened (I'm gettin' started)<br />
      Felt like giving up so many times before (I'm gettin' started)<br />
      But I'm still here grinding (I'm gettin' started)<br />
      I'm only gettin' started (I'm gettin' started)<br />
      Don't mean to be disheartened (I'm gettin' started)<br />
      Felt like giving up so many times before (I'm gettin' started)<br />
      But I'm still here grinding<br />
