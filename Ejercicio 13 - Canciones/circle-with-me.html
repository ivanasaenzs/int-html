    <h2>Letra</h2>
    [Intro]<br />
    Feel the weight of a martyr<br />
    It could all be yours<br />
    Cut down the altar<br /><br />
    [Verse 1]<br />
    Visionaire and deepest fake<br />
    Dirty gold, the colours change<br />
    Hands are frozen, feel no pain<br />
    I just wanna hold the flame<br /><br />
    [Pre-Chorus]<br />
    Negative feedback loop<br />
    I'm spinning out of control<br />
    The sickly sweetness is crushing me<br />
    But I wanna know<br />
    If there's no heat when I escalate, the fire is cold<br />
    They echo, "This could all be yours"<br /><br />
    [Chorus]<br />
    Feel the weight of a martyr<br />
    It could all be yours if you echo birds of preyv Traitor cut down the
    altar<br />
    It could all be yours<br />
    Vultures circling the flame<br /><br />
    [Verse 2]<br />
    Nothing sacred, nothing lost<br />
    When birds of prey invade my thoughts<br />
    They promise I will feel the pain<br />
    Not strong enough to hold the flame<br /><br />
    [Pre-Chorus]<br />
    Negative feedback loop<br />
    I'm spinning out of control<br />
    The sickly sweetness is crushing me<br />
    But I wanna know<br />
    If there's no heat when I escalate, the fire is cold<br />
    They echo, "This could all be yours"<br /><br />
    [Chorus]<br />
    Feel the weight of a martyr<br />
    It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey<br />
    Traitor cut down the altar<br />
    It could all be yours<br />
    Vultures circling the flame<br /><br />
    [Bridge]<br />
    I held the power of a dying sun<br />
    I climb the altar and I claim my place as God<br />
    Circle with me<br />
    Circle with me<br />
    This could all be yours<br /><br />
    [Chorus]<br />
    Feel the weight of a martyr<br />
    It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey<br />
    Traitor cut down the altar<br />
    It could all be yours<br />
    Vultures circling the flame<br /><br />
    [Post-Chorus]<br />
    Feel the weight of a martyr<br />
    A traitor watching me as<br />
    Birds of prey never falter<br />
    This could all be yours<br />
    This could all be yours<br /><br />
    [Outro]<br />
    Circle with me<br />
